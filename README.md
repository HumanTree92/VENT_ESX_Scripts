# About VENT_ESX_Scripts:
ESX Scripts Made by Human Tree92

I have at this time decided I will no longer be working on ESX. I have no Interest to further develop Scripts or work on Scripts for FiveM. I will keep the Github open just in case other people want to keep the scripts updated. If you want to rework my Scripts please contact me for Permission.

# Creating Issues:
* Check the [Closed Topics]( https://github.com/HumanTree92/VENT_ESX_Scripts/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed ) & [Wiki]( https://github.com/HumanTree92/VENT_ESX_Scripts/wiki ) before opening an issue to see if your issue has already been Answered.
* Do NOT Delete the Pre-Written Text in the issue.
* Make sure you have NOT edited anything besides the `config.lua`. I will NOT be providing support if you edit anything else.
* Failue to due any of the above will result in Topic being Deleted & you being Blocked. The Pre-Written text helps me with getting to the Bottom of the Issues & i hate explaining things over & over.

# Helpfull Info:
* I have decided to Combine all my Scripts into 1 Massive Script to make downloading Easier.
* Each Script has their Own README file so make sure you READ it so you know how to install everything.
* If you decide to make changes to anything outside of the `config.lua` i will not provide support for problems.
* I will not be doing Support for V1.3 - Unsupported.zip.
* Each Script has been tested on ESX V1.6 and wether or not it will work on any newer versions IDK.

# Requirements:
